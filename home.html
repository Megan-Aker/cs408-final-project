        <h3>Upcoming Improvements</h3>

        <p>
          Coming soon, this site will have the added feature of being able to view workouts!
          Oftentimes, beginners are unfamiliar with the types of exercises that are out there. 
          How to safely perform an exercise in the correct form is crucial and we want to teach 
          as many people as possible! Below is a video demonstration on how to perform a proper 
          barbell squat. This serves as an example as to what the site will include in the new 
          update. So get excited for the new features coming soon!

        <h3>About the Author</h3>
        <p>
          Hello users! I hope you enjoy my site and find it useful in your future workout endeavors! I've been 
          weightlifting for almost 3 years now and it is my favorite hobby. I find it a great way to relieve stress
          in a healthy and proactive way. I was once a beginner that had no idea what I was doing in the gym and found
          myself oftentimes intimidated. I out grew that eventually and found exercises and routines that worked for me. 
          Looking back, I wish that I tracked my workouts and nutrition better. It is very helpful for tracking progress and 
          progressively overloading overtime to get stronger. So I hope that you all find my site useful to you!
