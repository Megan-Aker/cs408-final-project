          So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed vision? In this article we try to answer those questions, and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.
        </p>

        <h3>Track Every Detail of Your Workout</h3>

        <h3>Upcoming Improvements</h3>

        <p>
          Coming soon, this site will have the added feature of being able to view workouts!
          Oftentimes, beginners are unfamiliar with the types of exercises that are out there. 
          How to safely perform an exercise in the correct form is crucial and we want to teach 
          as many people as possible! Below is a video demonstration on how to perform a proper 
          barbell squat. This serves as an example as to what the site will include in the new 
          update. So get excited for the new features coming soon!
